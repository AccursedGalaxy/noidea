# GitHub Integration and Enhanced Release Notes

This document explains how to use the GitHub integration features of NoIdea, including the AI-enhanced release notes generator.

## Setting Up GitHub Integration

The easiest way to set up GitHub integration is to run the setup script:

```bash
./scripts/setup-github.sh
```

This script will guide you through:
1. GitHub authentication using a Personal Access Token (PAT)
2. Installing GitHub hooks for automated release creation

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up GitHub integration manually, follow these steps:

1. Authenticate with GitHub:
   ```bash
   noidea github auth
   ```

2. Install GitHub hooks:
   ```bash
   noidea github hook-install
   ```

## Enhanced Release Notes

NoIdea can automatically generate well-structured, user-friendly release notes when you create a new tag or release.

### How it Works

When you create a new Git tag (either manually or using `./scripts/version.sh`), NoIdea will:

1. Gather all commit messages between the previous tag and the current tag
2. If AI is enabled, process these messages using a language model to create user-friendly notes
3. Generate a structured, organized release document grouped by change type
4. Create or update a GitHub release with these enhanced notes

### Using Enhanced Release Notes

The enhanced release notes feature integrates seamlessly with your existing workflow:

1. When running `./scripts/version.sh` to bump a version, enhanced release notes are generated automatically when you push the tag
2. If you create tags manually, the post-tag hook will trigger release note generation automatically
3. You can manually generate or update release notes for any tag:
   ```bash
   noidea github release notes --tag=v1.2.3
   ```

### AI-Powered Release Notes

If you have LLM features enabled in your NoIdea configuration, release notes will be generated using AI. This provides:

- Better organization of changes into logical sections
- More user-friendly language explaining technical changes
- Consistent formatting and style
- Focus on user impact rather than raw commit messages

To force AI-generation even if LLM is disabled in your config:

```bash
noidea github release notes --tag=v1.2.3 --ai
```

### Examples

Standard release notes (without AI):
```markdown
# Release v1.2.3
