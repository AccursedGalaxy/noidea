- Compare personal vs. team commit patterns
- Identify optimal coding hours based on commit quality

### Branch Manager Plugin
- Suggest branch cleanup (stale branches)
- Auto-naming branches based on commit intention
- Track branch health (how far behind/ahead of main)
- Generate branch usage statistics

### Commit Message Templates
- Team-specific commit templates

- Historical pattern matching for consistency
- Repository-specific terminology enforcement

## Feedback & Analysis Plugins

### Code Quality Insights
- Analyze commits for code quality metrics
- Provide suggestions for improving test coverage
- Flag potential security issues in commits
- Track code complexity trends over time

### Team Collaboration Analyzer
- Track who works on which parts of the codebase
- Generate collaboration graphs
- Identify knowledge silos and suggest knowledge sharing
- Create team attribution reports for leadership

### Language-Specific Feedback
- Tailored Moai feedback for specific languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- Framework-specific commit advice (React, Django, etc.)
- Best practices reminders for your tech stack
- Identify language-specific anti-patterns

## Fun & Productivity Plugins

### Commitment Tracker
- Gamify Git commits with achievements and streaks
- Set and track coding goals
- Generate "developer journey" reports
- Compete with teammates on commit quality metrics

### Themed Moai Personalities
- Movie character personalities (Yoda, Tony Stark, etc.)
- Historical figures (Einstein, Shakespeare, etc.)
- Special event themes (Halloween, Christmas, etc.)
- Team member impersonations (with their permission, of course!)

### Pomodoro Integration
- Track work sessions with Git commit grouping
- Suggest commit points at break times
- Analyze productivity across work sessions
- Recommend optimal work/break patterns based on your commit history

## Developer Tool Plugins

### Local LLM Support
- Add support for local LLM models (Ollama, LM Studio)
- Reduced API costs with offline operation
- Privacy-focused alternative
- Customized domain-specific model fine-tuning

### Documentation Generator
- Auto-generate/update README sections based on commits
- Create changelog entries from commit history
- Generate code comments based on changes
- Maintain API documentation in sync with code

### Dependency Analyzer
- Track dependencies added in commits
- Flag potential dependency vulnerabilities
- Suggest updates based on commits and compatibility
- Monitor dependency bloat and suggest alternatives

## Domain-Specific Plugins

### Semantic Version Enforcer
- Analyze commits to suggest semantic version bumps
- Enforce versioning policies
- Generate version histories with summaries
- Automate version bumping based on commit content

### Conventional Commits Validator
- Enforce conventional commit message format
- Provide guided commit message creation
- Show team compliance with commit standards
- Convert non-conventional commits to conventional format

### Code Review Assistant
- Pre-analyze commits for common issues before review
- Generate review checklists based on changed files
- Track recurring feedback to prevent repeat issues
- Suggest reviewers based on expertise and availability

## Implementation Suggestions

When implementing plugins, consider these approaches:

### Integration Plugins
Focus on clean API abstractions and configuration options:
```go
// Example JIRA integration plugin
type JIRAConfig struct {
    URL      string
    Username string
    Token    string
    Project  string
}

func (p *JIRAPlugin) Initialize(ctx plugin.PluginContext) error {
    // Read configuration
    config := JIRAConfig{}
    if err := ctx.Config().Get("jira", &config); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to load JIRA configuration: %w", err)
    }
    
    // Initialize JIRA client
    p.client = jira.NewClient(config.URL, config.Username, config.Token)
    
    // Register hooks
    return ctx.RegisterHooks(plugin.Hooks{
        Commit: &JIRACommitHooks{client: p.client, project: config.Project},
    })
}
```

### UI Enhancement Plugins
Consider accessibility and terminal compatibility:
```go
// Example colorful UI plugin
func (h *ColorfulUIHooks) BeforeOutput(output string) (string, error) {
    // Check if color is disabled
    if noColor, _ := strconv.ParseBool(os.Getenv("NO_COLOR")); noColor {
        return output, nil
    }
    
    // Add colorful formatting
    output = strings.ReplaceAll(output, "Success:", color.GreenString("Success:"))
    output = strings.ReplaceAll(output, "Warning:", color.YellowString("Warning:"))
    output = strings.ReplaceAll(output, "Error:", color.RedString("Error:"))
    
    return output, nil
}
```

### Analysis Plugins
Handle large repositories efficiently:
```go
// Example code complexity analyzer
func (h *ComplexityHooks) OnCollectStats(stats map[string]interface{}) error {
    // Process in chunks to avoid memory issues
    if commits, ok := stats["commits"].([]interface{}); ok {
        const chunkSize = 100
        for i := 0; i < len(commits); i += chunkSize {
            end := i + chunkSize
            if end > len(commits) {
                end = len(commits)
            }
            
            chunk := commits[i:end]
            if err := h.processCommitChunk(chunk); err != nil {
                return err
            }
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

## Getting Started

To start developing your own plugin, see the [Plugin Examples](examples.md) document for practical implementation guidance. The [Interface Specifications](interfaces.md) document provides detailed technical specifications for plugin interfaces.

We encourage community contributions! When you develop a plugin, consider sharing it with others by submitting it to our plugin registry.
