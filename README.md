# 🧠 noidea — The Git Extension You Never Knew You Needed

> Commit with confidence. Or shame. Probably shame.

**noidea** is a lightweight, plug-and-play Git extension that adds ✨fun and occasionally useful ✨feedback into your normal Git workflow.

Every time you commit, a mysterious Moai appears to judge your code.

---

## 🗿 What It Does

After every `git commit`, you'll see something like:

```
🗿  (ಠ_ಠ) Your commit message was 'fix final final pls real'
"You’ve entered the 2AM hotfix arc. A legendary time."
```

Whether your code is clean or cursed, the Moai sees all.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install the binary**

(coming soon — cross-platform release)

For now, build from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/noidea.git
cd noidea
go build -o noidea
```

2. **Run `noidea init`**

```
./noidea init
```

This installs a Git `post-commit` hook in your repo.

3. **Commit your sins**

```
git commit -m "fix maybe this time"
```

And witness the Moai’s judgment.
